scrapyItemCrawler



This is a simple application written using Play Framework 2.1.
In the background I am using a scrapy crawler to crawl an it 
products online-shop. The user can choose a product based on
the manufacturer, price of the product and category. As a result
a query will be sent to solr and 10 first products will be displayed.
All the products will show the short description of the product, the 
manufacturer, the price and also the link to the shop.

Everything on the Play Framework side is written in Java.
For parsing I used the simple SAXParser that is built into
Java. 
The crawler that crawls the shop is written using scrapy 
and naturally Python.
For storing the product data I used Solr 4.3.0
I used 2 cores in solr and added to project directory
only both schemas needed for these cores.
(Hint: to make another core, simply copy the collection1
folder that is in the example project. Change the schema, 
add the name of the collection to the solr.xml file like 
the first one has been added and run solr via start.jar and that is it.)
